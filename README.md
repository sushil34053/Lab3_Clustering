Lab 3: Clustering Analysis Using K-Means and K-Medoids Algorithms

Purpose

The purpose of this project is to explore clustering techniques using the Wine Dataset. We are goign to compare K-Means and K-Medoids performance.

The folllowing are the results we got from the notebook. 

K-Means:

Silhouette Score: 0.28

Adjusted Rand Index (ARI): 0.90

K-Medoids:

Silhouette Score: 0.27

Adjusted Rand Index (ARI): 0.73

Comparison

Those results indicates taht K-Means aligned better with true labels for it has a higher ARI. We can also see that the two methods are similar in terms of cohesion which is indicated by Silhouette Score.

Files Included

The two files included in this repository are

Lab3_Clustering.ipynb: Implementation and visualizations.

README.md: Summary of results and insights.
